  initialDialogue:
  - Rumors spread like wildfire back then. Word got out about the tree...whispers
    about something of great value, hidden in the town.
  - A nobleman caught wind of it from miles away, demanding to know what we had.
    He sat across from me, demanding the secret behind our harvests, our good fortune.
  - "I refused to tell him. I told him--we have no secret. The tree\u2019s power
    wasn\u2019t something you could take or steal. It was the heart of this place,
    of our people."
