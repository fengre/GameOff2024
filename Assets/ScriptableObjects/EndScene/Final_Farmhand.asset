  initialDialogue:
  - He came back... the nobleman. Angrier than before. He wanted that tree, wanted
    its power, and when our leader refused...
  - He burned everything. The crops, the homes, the very earth itself. He set fire
    to it all, as if trying to erase us.
  - "We fought, but there was no chance. And now, all that\u2019s left is this\u2014memory,
    regret, and the cold wind through the ruins."
