  initialDialogue:
  - "There was a time when the town was full of life\u2014boats lined the docks,
    and the market full of laughter."
  - 'But the real magic... that was in the old tree at the heart of the town. The
    one we made offerings to, asking for a good harvest, a bountiful hunt. '
  - Now, we're all wandering the village like shadows, caught in a memory of what
    we had.
