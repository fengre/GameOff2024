  initialDialogue:
  - "I remember playing with my baby brother. I would make him giggle when I\u2019d
    rock him or play peek-a-boo with his tiny hands. He always looked at me like
    I was his whole world."
  - "I haven\u2019t seen him since that day. But I\u2019d know him anywhere. I\u2019d
    recognize his smile, his soft little hands, even if I saw him from miles away."
