  initialDialogue:
  - "I thought I could save him... my baby. I placed him in a basket, hoping the
    river would carry him far from the fire, far from the nobleman\u2019s wrath.
    I prayed someone would find him, raise him."
  - I ran back to the village, desperate to find my husband and little girl. But
    when I got there... the flames had already claimed everything. The fire took
    us all.
  - And now, all I have left is an empty town, and a question... did the river carry
    my baby to safety, or did it, too, take him?
