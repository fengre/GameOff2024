  initialDialogue:
  - A village... here? I wasn't expecting to see anything for miles.
  - It looks abandoned. The houses, the streets... not a soul in sight. Strange.
  - "Wait\u2026 could this be the place from the stories?"
  - "The village where no one knows what happened. They say the people went mad...
    tore each other apart. Everything\u2026 gone."
  - "But that was just a legend\u2026 wasn\u2019t it?"
  - "Wait\u2026 no. That\u2019s not possible."
  - A little girl?
